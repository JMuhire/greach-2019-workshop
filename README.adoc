= Observability Workshop

A hands on playground for learning observability basics in a hands on fashion.

Infra runs in docker compose

[source,bash]
----
{project}/infra/$ docker-compose up

The labs all work best if you move into that folder or the subprojects folder to run gradle commands.

[source,bash]
----
cd {project}/lab-01/edge-ratpack/
gradle run
